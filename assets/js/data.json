	"about":   [
		"Hello, I’m Ray Beliveau, a web developer, actor, and YouTube content creator based out of RoundRock., Texas. I have a passion for exploring new ideas, creativity and solving puzzles, which I often find places itself into everything that I do. Yes, I'm slightly nerdy and proud of it!",
		"I started programming At 15, when I taught myself Assembly, and eventually moved over to HTML, PHP and Linux. My first website was a U2 fan page on Angelfire. Now that I’ve dated myself, I have over 10 years of experience (and we’ll leave it at that). One of my most recent projects parses Facebook membership requests and pulls student data from YouTube's Data API. I've continued to round out my skill set by participating in a coding bootcamp at University of Texas San Antonio, where I am learning more about web technologies.",
		"Besides web development, I am also passionate about creating videos that provide value by educating people about studio gear, video editing and stories about life."
